### Course Information
- **Instructor**: Dr. Saharnaz Babaei-Balderlou
- **Course**: Data Analysis (ECO230)
- **Course AI TA**: Quokka Query (QQ) 
QQ is an AI teaching assistant I trained specifically for this course. It is designed to help you review concepts, practice data analysis, and get quick explanations outside of class. Think of it as a 24/7 study partner or a tutor -- not a replacement for class discussions, but a way to reinforce what we do together.
