### Course Information
- **Instructor**: Dr. Saharnaz Babaei-Balderlou
- **Course**: Global Macroeconomics (ECO120)
- **Course AI TA**: Macro Buddy 
Macro Buddy is an AI teaching assistant I trained specifically for this course. It is designed to help you review concepts, practice macroeconomic reasoning, and get quick explanations outside of class. Think of it as a 24/7 study partner -- not a replacement for class discussions, but a way to reinforce what we do together.
