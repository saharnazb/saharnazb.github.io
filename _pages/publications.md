### <span style="font-weight: bold;">The Promises and Pitfalls of Government-Funded Teacher Staffing Initiatives on Teacher Employment in Hard-to-Staff Schools: Evidence from South Carolina</span>
**Policy Futures in Education, 2022**, with Tran H. and Smith D.

##### Abstract:
Situated against teacher demand problems worldwide, rising teacher turnover and declining teacher education enrollment have rendered the state of South Carolina a region commonly described as facing a “teacher shortage crisis.” This paper evaluates the Rural Recruitment Initiative (RRI) in South Carolina, which aims to improve teacher retention in hard-to-staff districts through discretionary funding and flexible purposes. Utilizing a Difference-in-Differences model, the analysis reveals that RRI has a modest impact, reducing teacher turnover by less than 1\%. The findings suggest slightly better retention in rural fringe districts but highlight the need for continued support and possibly expanding the initiative to achieve more significant results and a longer evaluation period to better assess the policy's overall effectiveness.
