##### Abstract:
This study investigates the impact of frontloading salary structures (higher early-career salaries) on teacher turnover using data from South Carolina public school districts in the U.S. from FY2014- FY2023. Employing a Difference-in-Differences (DID) model, the analysis reveals that frontloading salary schedules is associated with lower turnover among novice teachers but have a less pronounced effect on seasoned educators. The study highlights that the impact of frontloading varies by district demographics and teacher qualifications. Results indicate that higher experience premiums for early-career teachers can increase turnover when compared to mid-career premiums, suggesting a need for balanced salary structures, targeted financial incentives.

##### Abstract:
Situated against teacher demand problems worldwide, rising teacher turnover and declining teacher education enrollment have rendered the state of South Carolina a region commonly described as facing a ‚Äúteacher shortage crisis.‚Äù This paper evaluates the Rural Recruitment Initiative (RRI) in South Carolina, which aims to improve teacher retention in hard-to-staff districts through discretionary funding and flexible purposes. Utilizing a Difference-in-Differences model, the analysis reveals that RRI has a modest impact, reducing teacher turnover by less than 1\%. The findings suggest slightly better retention in rural fringe districts but highlight the need for continued support and possibly expanding the initiative to achieve more significant results and a longer evaluation period to better assess the policy's overall effectiveness.
