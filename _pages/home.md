#### About me

<div class="justified">
I am a Teaching Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse (UWL), where I joined the Department of Economics in Fall 2024. I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from the Darla Moore School of Business at the University of South Carolina, with a focus on applied microeconomics. My research lies at the intersection of labor economics, education policy, and the integration of artificial intelligence into education and labor markets. I am particularly interested in how public policy can improve outcomes for historically underserved and marginalized communities.

  I have taught a range of undergraduate courses, including Introduction to Economics and Principles of Microeconomics at USC, and Global Macroeconomics and Data Analysis for Business Applications at UWL.
  
  Originally from Urmia, Iran, I completed both my bachelor’s and master’s degrees in Economics at Urmia University, a top-tier public university. I was admitted through Iran’s highly competitive national entrance exam (Konkour), and my education was fully funded by the government based on academic merit. In both degrees, I graduated at the top of my class: ranked 2nd out of 60 students in my undergraduate cohort and 3rd out of 30 in my master’s program.
  
  As a first-generation college graduate, the first in my family whose parents did not attend college, these early milestones instilled in me a deep commitment to education and equity. These values continue to shape my teaching and research today.
