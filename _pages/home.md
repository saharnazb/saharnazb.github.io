#### About me

<div class="justified">
I am an Assistant Teaching Professor of Economics at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse. I joined the UWL Department of Economics in Fall 2024. I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from the Darla Moore School of Business at the University of South Carolina (USC), specializing in applied microeconomics. My research focuses on labor economics and economics of education. My primary area of research interest on these topics lies at the intersection of diversity and inclusion, and public policy analysis. I have the experience of teaching Introduction to Economics and Principles of Microeconomics at USC and teaching introductory level Macroeconomics at UWL. I am originally from Urmia, Iran, and I earned my Master's and Bachelor's degree in economics from Urmia University.
