#### About me

<div class="justified">
I am a Teaching Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Wisconsin - La Crosse (UWL), where I joined the Department of Economics in Fall 2024. I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from the Darla Moore School of Business at the University of South Carolina, with a focus on applied microeconomics. My research lies at the intersection of labor economics, education policy, and the integration of artificial intelligence into education and labor markets. I am particularly interested in how public policy can improve outcomes for historically underserved and marginalized communities.

  I have taught a range of undergraduate courses, including Introduction to Economics and Principles of Microeconomics at USC, and Global Macroeconomics and Data Analysis for Business Applications at UWL.
